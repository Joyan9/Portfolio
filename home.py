    As a data analyst, I analyzed data from an Indian cab service provider to understand market penetration patterns across 10 cities. The project involved:
    - **Key Objectives**:
      - Identifying business vs. tourism-focused cities using trip volumes, fares, and distances.
      - Analyzing seasonal trends and weather impacts on demand.
      - Evaluating customer retention with repeat rates and satisfaction metrics.
    - **Tools Used**: Excel, Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Canva.
    - **Outcome**: Strategic recommendations for dynamic pricing, loyalty programs, and service enhancements.
    - **Key Findings**:
      - High retention doesn't always correlate with satisfaction (e.g., Surat and Lucknow had 40%+ repeat rates despite low satisfaction scores).
      - Discovered operational differences between tourist hubs and business centers.
      - Exposed inconsistencies in new vs. repeat passenger ratings (8.65 vs. 6.96).
